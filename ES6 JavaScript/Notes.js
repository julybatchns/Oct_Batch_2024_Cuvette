// * JavaScript, created by Brendan Eich in 1995, is one of the most widely used web development languages. It was designed to build dynamic web pages at first. A script is a JS program that may be added to the HTML of any web page. When the page loads, these scripts execute automatically.

// ? A language that was originally designed to build dynamic web pages may now be run on the server and on almost any device that has the JavaScript Engine installed.

// ! After HTML and CSS, JavaScript is the third biggest web technology. JavaScript is a scripting language that may be used to construct online and mobile apps, web servers, games, and more. JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that is used to generate websites and applications. It was created with the intention of being used in a browser. Even today, the server-side version of JavaScript known as Node.js may be used to create online and mobile apps, real-time applications, online streaming applications, and videogames. Javascript frameworks, often known as inbuilt libraries, may be used to construct desktop and mobile programs. Developers may save a lot of time on monotonous programming jobs by using these code libraries, allowing them to focus on the production work of development.

// Terminologies

// Function, Variable, Datatypes, Operator, Method, class, keywords, literals, value, property.

// ! JavaScript is a high-level programming language used for web development. It is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one command at a time, and is interpreted, meaning it is not compiled before execution.

// * V8 is a high-performance JavaScript engine developed by Google and used in their Chrome browser, as well as other applications. It compiles JavaScript code to machine code, improving its performance.

// ? JavaScript is primarily used for client-side scripting, meaning it runs on the user's web browser, and is used to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS.

// # Execution Context

// ! JavaScript Execution Context is the environment in which JavaScript code is executed. It contains information about the variables, functions, and objects that are available to the code being executed.

const document = {
  html: {
    head: {
      meta: "utf",
      meta: "utf",
      meta: "utf",
      title: "DOM",
    },
    body: {
      h1: "DOM",
      p: "dfsfsf",
      div: {
        section: "dasfd",
      },
    },
  },
};

//? The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects, allowing developers to interact with and manipulate the HTML and CSS of a webpage programmatically using JavaScript.

// Structure
// Styling
// Content

// ! 1. DOM Structure
// ? The DOM represents an HTML document as a tree structure of nodes.
// * Document node: Represents the entire document.
// ? Element nodes: Represent HTML elements (e.g., <div>, <p>).
// ! Text nodes: Represent text within an element.
// ? Attribute nodes: Represent attributes of elements (e.g., class, id).

// ! 2. Accessing the DOM
// document.getElementById("")
