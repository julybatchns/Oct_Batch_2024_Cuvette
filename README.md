<!-- 1. Introduction to Web Development -->

## 1. Definition: Web development is the process of creating websites or web applications for the internet (or an intranet). It involves both design (how the website looks) and programming (how the website works).

# Types of Web Development:

- Frontend Development: Focuses on what users see and interact with directly in the browser. This includes web design, UI/UX, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Backend Development: Focuses on the server, databases, and application logic. It involves server-side languages like Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.

- Semantic HTML Elements (header, footer, sidebar, article, nav, )
- Non-Semantic HTML Elements (div)

# CSS Units

- CSS units are used to define lengths, sizes, spacing, and other measurements in styles.

1. Absolute Units - pixel (px) - A pixel is a tiny unit of measurement relative to the screen's resolution.
2. Relative Units - %, vh, vw, rem, em

# CSS Grid

- CSS Grid is a powerful layout system in CSS that provides a way to create flexible, responsive, and two-dimensional layouts. It allows for arranging elements in rows and columns with ease, making it suitable for both simple and complex designs.
