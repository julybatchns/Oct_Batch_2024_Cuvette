## Core Concepts in Programming

- Syntax: The rules and structure of a programming language (like grammar in human languages). Each language has its syntax, which must be followed.

Data Types: Different kinds of data, like numbers (integers), text (strings), and true/false values (booleans).
Integer: Whole numbers (e.g., 10, -4).
String: Text data (e.g., "Hello").
Boolean: Logical values, true or false.

Operators: Symbols that perform operations on variables and values.
Arithmetic operators: +, -, \*, / for basic math.
Comparison operators: ==, !=, <, >, which compare values.
